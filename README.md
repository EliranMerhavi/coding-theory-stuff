the is a project where i implement random stuff in the coding theory field

i loved the topic of data compression for a long time and decided to try to implement the huffman encoding in cpp.
since then i found to the field of information thoery very interesting and started to learn about random algorithms such as arithemtic encoding, bws and more.
after that i started to learn about error correcting codes and started to learn and implement the reed solomon encoding.

i find that the coding thory field in computer science is one of the most useful fields in computer science and im planning to learn as much as i can about this field whenever ill get the chance.

some of the algorithms i learned are not shown in this repo yet

i know this repo is a bit messy ill organize this when ill have the time
